Lab1 – context switch
Lab2 – IPC
Lab3 – user process & system call
Lab4 – file system

3.This is “the hardest” lab course
pure C language
Linux CLI
about 5000+ lines of code
no libaray functions is avaliable
materials are not easy to understand
debugging is “inconvenient”
You will fail, fail, fail, fail, ..., then secceed.
